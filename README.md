Initially, each box should have a background color chosen from a random list of colors.
When you click any box: it should change its color to a different random color.

#### 20 - React Router:

20_Route_as_useState - to show a kind-of navigation, but we don't get:\
‚ùå a different URL as we move around pages\
‚ùå the ability to use the back/forward browser buttons\
‚ùå any way to bookmark a "page" on the site\
‚ùå more complex route/pattern matching\

20_2_Route_as_Rout - <Link> vs <a href="">; <NavLink> when active for easier styling.

#### 21 - Vending Machine Exercise:

- React Router and Routs basics;\
- <Link> and <NavLink> navigation;\
- props.children.\

#### 22 - React_Router_Patterns:

- Patterns to built routes in React;\
- useParams() - hook to retrive url parameters from the current route;\
- adding 404 page;\
- search form - to take a user to another place on your webpage using <Link> and path inside it to show up in the url;\
- Redirects in React Router - mimic the behaviour of SSR. Using <Navigate > from react-router-dom /under version #6 of react-router used <Redirect>, it is <Naigate> now/;\
- <useNavigate>. The .push method on the history object is no longer available in React Router v6. React Router v6 introduced a new API that simplifies navigation and eliminates the history prop. Instead of history.push and <withRouter>, you now use the useNavigate hook to programmatically navigate between routes.
- history.goBack() method has been replaced with the navigate(-1) method, which is provided by the useNavigate hook. This allows you to navigate back to the previous page in the browser's history stack.
